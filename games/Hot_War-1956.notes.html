The Cold War becomes hot in 1956. The Soviet Bloc contends for supremacy against the west.
<br>The rules of AA50 are followed for the most part. The exceptions are
<br> The nuclear powers (US,USSR,UK) have heavy bombers (3 dice). The number can be edited.
<br> Ships can move 3 (US doctrine allowed rapid movement of forces)
<br> Subs defend at 2 (subs had improved since WW2)
<br> Bombers move 10 (intercontinental bombers)
<br> Bombers attack at only 1 (they are not designed for Tac Air support)
<br> Bombers defend at 6 (defensive use of nukes)
<br> AA Guns cost 3 and are destructible (interceptors)
<br> Factories are unbuildable and are destructible (nuked cities are hard to replace)
<br> No PU's are gained from taking capitals
<br> Soviet Bloc wins by achieving 150 PU of income
<br> West Bloc wins achieving 250 PU of income
<br> Note that some territories starting with units from different sides in them
<br> Income values are based upon the Maddison database (see http://axisandallies.wikia.com/wiki/Maddison_Database)
<br> Unit setup was created for balance, with little reference to actual forces
